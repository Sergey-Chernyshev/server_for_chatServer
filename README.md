# Chat on sockets on C++
----
## About this project
When I started learning c++, I was very interested in the topic of creating a server. I decided to create my own console chat. This project was implemented by a beginner, so do not judge strictly)
To start the server and use it for chat, you need to install and run the client part

## How to start
clone repository
    gh repo clone Sergey-Chernyshev/ServerByClass
установите соответсвующие зависимости и настройте проект
запустите клиент и сервер
используйте консольные команды и общайтесь)
